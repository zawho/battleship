September 16, 2024 - I am now beginning the Battleship project as a part of The Odin Project's Javascript track. I will be making a version of the Battleship board game. One of the major goals of this project will be to implement Test Driven Development, including mocking if need be.

August 20, 2025 - After numerous delays, life happenings, and other projects I have finally finished the Battleship project. In addition to completing the basic project as an exercise in TDD, I also implemented two of the three extra credit features listed in the TOP project: a drag and drop placement system and improved computer opponent code. Took much longer than I expected but I'm quite happy with the end result.
